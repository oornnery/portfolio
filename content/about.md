## Who I am

I am a backend-focused software engineer who enjoys turning product ideas into
maintainable systems.
My main stack is Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, with a strong focus on
operational quality.

## What I value

- Clear architecture and explicit boundaries
- Reliable APIs with strong validation
- Security by default
- Logs and traces that support fast debugging

## Experience focus

I have worked mostly on:

- API design and domain modeling
- Integrations with third-party services
- Background jobs and async processing
- Production observability and incident response

## Current interests

- AI-assisted developer workflows
- Secure form and webhook pipelines
- Performance tuning in Python services
- Better deployment and release practices
