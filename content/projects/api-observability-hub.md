## Overview

This project started as a reusable backend baseline for production services.
It provides request lifecycle tracing, security middleware, and clear
dependency boundaries.

## Highlights

- Request ID propagation across all logs
- Unified error responses
- Config-first initialization with environment validation
- Route-level use cases with dependency injection

## Why it matters

Most API projects fail in operations, not in local development.
This template reduces that risk by making observability and security
first-class concerns.
